# MultipurposeMod
so far, the mod is in development

## If you want to help

I'm making a minecraft mod that will combine all the mods I use in the game. the list of these mods is [here](https://github.com/WyslowMod/MultipurposeMod/blob/main/texts/modlist.md)

## Why am I doing this

to improve your skills in modding and to understand how these mods work and to understand how to update them to new versions of minecraft
